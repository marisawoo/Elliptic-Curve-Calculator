# Elliptic-Curve-Calculator
Elliptic curve: E(Fp): Y^2 =X^3+AX+B \
More specifically F = Z_p, p prime

```findSet(p, a, b)``` \
Given p prime, A, B, ```findSet``` returns the set of F-rational points on E as well as the cardinality of the set. \
Note: ```findSet``` does not check if p is prime, please enter a number which is prime.

Run with Python console.
